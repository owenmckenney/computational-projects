# Upright Equilibrium Balance of an Inverted Pendulum using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control

In this project, I implemented Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to drive a inverted pendulum cart to an upright equilibrium position. 
Derivations and write-up of NMPC are coming soon (drafting write-up as of 12/25)
